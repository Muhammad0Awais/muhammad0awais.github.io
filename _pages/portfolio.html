Projects
======
 Here's the provided information converted into Markdown format:

- **Music and Image Search (Course Project)**
  - Implemented a music search using the constellation algorithm following the strategy of Shazam and an image search using SIFT features.
  - Developed and optimized algorithms to achieve fast and accurate results. [code](https://github.com/Muhammad0Awais/Music-Shazam-and-Images-retrieval-SIFT/blob/main/Music(Shazam)%20and%20Images%20retrieval(SIFT).ipynb)

- **Document Retrieval Algorithm (Course Project)**
  - Implemented an algorithm to use TF/IDF to index documents and retrieve the ones that matched a query.
  - Utilized natural language processing techniques to improve the search results. [code](https://github.com/Muhammad0Awais/Search-Engine-based-document-processing-pipeline)

- **Malicious Content Detection (Hackathon Project)**
  - Addressed the problem of content filtering by employing machine learning models to detect malicious content.
  - Utilized OpenCV to blur content and speech recognition to detect and beep malicious content.
  - Developed and tested a pipeline for real-time content filtering. [Link](https://github.com/Muhammad0Awais/sber_zvuk_hackathon)

- **Advertisements Assessment (Hackathon Project)**
  - Developed an ML pipeline using YOLOV3 to assess advertisements on walls and aid decision-makers in formulating advertising strategies.
  - Conducted extensive testing to ensure high accuracy and reliable performance. [Link](https://github.com/Muhammad0Awais/Yolo-based-Advertistment-Analysis)

- **Image Correction Algorithms Benchmarking (Hackathon Project)**
  - Benchmark and compared various image correction algorithms for a video streaming company to determine the best algorithms for maximizing streaming quality.
  - Utilized super-resolution techniques to improve the image quality. [Presentation LINK](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Se1o_hMCWlAHoOfg0WZPiOq0BHkbMQqtqk8hPIKTFJM/edit?usp=sharing)
